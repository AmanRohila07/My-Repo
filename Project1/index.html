                <p>
                    The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw <b>Rahul Dravid</b> as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[52] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[52] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[53] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[54] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.

                <p>
                    In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper,[56] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.
